# Cinejump! - ES6
## About the project
This is a simple web app that fetches the TMDB (The Movie DataBase) and allows the user to see some of the most popular and the twenty latest movies in Brazil. The user can also create a list of its favorite movies just by clicking over a title. It was developed by using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (Ecma Script 5 and above).

This project is part of a [WebJump](https://www.webjump.com.br) program, called _Academia Webjump_, where new employees have the chance to increase their skills by studying, coding, and presenting projects in what area they work in.

*Webjump* is one of the most influential Magento partners in the world, specialized in personalized eCommerce development for middle market and enterprise customers.
